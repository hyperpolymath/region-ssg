**Parallel array-region site generation in ZPL.**
"Region" — Site synthesis as a spatial computation. Every page is a coordinate in a multi-processor grid.

== Who Is This For?
* **Scientific Computing** veterans who view site structure as a global index space.
* **High-Performance Architects** requiring implicit data parallelism across distributed memory.

== Why region-ssg?
=== Region-Based Partitioning
ZPL allows the definition of `regions` that govern how array operations apply. In `region-ssg`, your site is partitioned into these regions, allowing the compiler to automatically allot computations to different processors.

=== Implicit Concurrency
Because ZPL uses an array abstraction for a vector-oriented model, it achieves concurrency without parallel directives. Parallelism arises naturally from the semantics of your site transformations.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Prepare the ZPL abstract parallel machine
just setup
# Define the global site region and build
just build --region "[1..1000, 1..50]"
